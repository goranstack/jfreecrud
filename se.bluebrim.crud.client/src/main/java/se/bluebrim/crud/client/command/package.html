This article describes how the exception handling in the CRUD framework is done.
One additional complexity in a client server system is that you have to be carful
with the exceptions you serialize so that they also exist on the client.
As a consequence there are two fault barriers. One at the client side and one at the server side.
The server side fault barrier catch all faults and log them to the server log. After that it throws
a new exception WITHOUT wrapping the old one. The reason is:
 1. Avoid serialization problems with wrapped exceptions that do not exist at client side.
 2. It's no good to display server side stack traces on the client. They should be kept at server side.

Below is one of the good postings about this article:

<h2>Re: Effective Java Exceptions</h2>
People who defend checked exceptions claim that they should represent
recoverable errors. Fine. Except for one thing: whether the particular
error in a particular application is recoverable or not is defined by
the business requirements of that application! The same type of error
may require an alternative action in one application, while treated as a
generic fault by another. Expecting the compiler to tell you what to do
with an error is wrong – and, well, incompetent! Not to mention: over
90% of all errors in most applications are (or should be) treated as
non-recoverable. Gosling’s unbelievable suggestion that checked
exceptions were designed to create a “creepy” feeling that something may
go wrong is mind-boggling! Every junior software engineer should
understand that “something” might ALWAYS go wrong in a piece of
software! Checked exceptions are creating just the opposite effect:
developers now feel completely “safe” and do NOTHING if the compiler
does not remind them of an exception! Handling a checked exception is
never enough because any such exception generally represents only a
subset of all possible errors. People have forgotten – and many never
have learnt – that error handling must be designed for, that it is an
essential part of the application’s architecture and design. Instead, it
has become an afterthought for most Java developers.
<br>
<br>
People often ask: "Without checked exceptions, how do I know which error
to expect/handle?" This question reflects the most common misconception
about error handling. You do not need to know anything other than what
is stated in the business requirements for your application. Everything
else should be treated as "something bad that really wasn't meant to
happen per design." This makes the general error handling strategy very
simple! (Yes, there has to be a STRATEGY.) Here are the simple tasks
that the developer/application designer must face when designing the
high-level layout for the application:
<br>
<br>
1. Determine the location for the top-level handler that will catch all
errors that bubble up to it from within the application/module. This is
usually a "try/catch (Throwable t)/finally" construct around the process
that implements the main task of your application or component/module.
Call it a “fault barrier”, or whatever you want…
<br>
<br>
2. Get familiar with the business requirements (funny that I should
mention that! :)) and single out the legitimate use cases where an error
should be caught and handled before it reaches the above-mentioned
top-level handler. Such handling will mean implementing an alternative
action in response to the error. Such cases will represent your business
errors. Note that since these errors are documented in your own business
requirements, shame on you if you need the compiler to remind you about
them! ;) It doesn’t matter if your business analyst did not supply you
with well-stated requirements. You should have a set of well-defined
design concepts (provided by someone else or gathered by yourself before
you start coding.) You must design for all those alternative actions. In
most cases, you won’t even need to distinguish between the types of
errors occurred, just catch all possible exceptions in that API and
redirect your process accordingly. In rare cases, yes, you might have to
investigate the API a bit deeper to look for a more specific exception
type. For example, you may want to distinguish the Spring's
DataRetrievalFailureException from a NullPointerException. The former
indicates that your data was not retrieved from the database; the latter
indicates something totally unacceptable that has nothing to do with the
business case. But such details are easy to uncover - if you look for
them when following nothing but your business requirements. What
developers must remember is that they absolutely must design for error
handling. Instead, most Java programmers today thoughtlessly catch just
about anything that the compiler points at, put wrappers around
wrappers, re-throw useless exceptions but chop-off valuable stack
traces, log the same error dozens of times at each step in the call
stack, etc.
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, in practice, most applications have very few cases of the
distinct legitimate "business" cases mentioned in step 2.
<br>
<br>
3. Ensure that each error propagates freely from the source of the error
to the only dedicated handler that is designed to handle it, the handler
that has the sufficient application context to handle the error
properly. Under no circumstances, the error should be caught and
tinkered with before it reaches that handler.
<br>
<br>
4. When some (3rd party/JDK) code throws a checked exception, catch it
in your API, and since, most likely, you don’t want to handle it
immediately at the source of the error, wrap it inside your custom RT
exception and re-throw so it can freely propagate to the dedicated (by
design) handler w/o polluting the rest of your code on its way.
<br>
<br>
5. When re-throwing exceptions, always nest the cause exception within
the new exceptions. Never discard the original error.
<br>
6. Always log the exception – with the full stack trace - when the
dedicated handler ultimately catches it. And log it once.
<br>
<br>
Run-time exceptions were designed to ensure all of that. Most
importantly, they were designed to allow developers not to deal with
errors at their immediate source but rather at the central point where
the application was designed to handle them, while providing the
developer with the complete stack trace information between the error
source and the handler. The fact that the original JDK implementations –
all the way up to 1.4 - provided no nesting functionality in the
Exception class while forcing developers to deal with exceptions at the
very source if each error - demonstrates how ill-conceived the whole
idea was in its core from the beginning.
<br>
<br>
Mixing checked and unchecked exceptions, as most people suggest, is a
bad idea. As I have said, handling the specific checked exception in
response to the compiler's complaint is never enough. If you stop there,
you are guaranteed to miss something that will blow up your application.
Therefore, you still have to do everything described above in 1 - 6,
except your code is now polluted with tons of specific (most certainly,
unnecessary) handlers that may interrupt an essential exception on its
way to the one and only correct handler, which inevitably results in the
loss of error information. If we can't reliably mix RT and checked
exceptions, and we don't like RT exceptions, can we indeed make all
exceptions checked? The answer is, most certainly, NO. There is a reason
why the authors of Java didn't do that in the first place. They just
couldn't. That would have made the language totally unusable. Every
method would have to declare countless exceptions in its signature, and
every method would have to deal with the countless checked exceptions
thrown by the code inside. What for? Just to create that “creepy”
feeling Gosling is so proud about?
<br>
<br>
Finally, look at Sun's EJB3!!! Wow! No checked exceptions there! A
silent admission of the mistake? But how many "average" programmers have
noticed? There’s nothing wrong with making mistakes, and no one has ever
claimed that Java was perfect. Many things have been improved and
corrected in the language since its first release. It is time for Sun to
come out and start helping the industry to recover from this terrible
experiment that has resulted in nothing less than millions of
programmers who are clueless about error-handling! That, in turn, costs
companies hundreds of millions of wasted dollars. Sadly, no matter how
many of the brightest people in the industry have spoken against checked
exceptions (Rod Johnson, Bruce Eckel, Anders Hejlsberg, to name a few),
it has had almost no impact on the programming “masses.” This forum just
proves that.
